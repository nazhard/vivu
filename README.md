## Why?

Inspired by [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse), and I also use vue a lot, so I made this because too many same setup would be a little tiring.

This template is basically for personal use, but I thought this was pretty cool. And yeah, you can see the [preview here](https://vivu.pages.dev)
